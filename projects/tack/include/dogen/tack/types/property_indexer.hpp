/**
 * @brief Information indexer that specialises in indexing
 * properties across the model.
 *
 * @section tack_property_indexer_0 Model requirements
 *
 * The concept indexer expects to receive a partial model such as ones
 * coming straight out of Dia to Tack transformation. The indexing of
 * concepts is expected to have taken place.
 *
 * @section tack_property_indexer_1 Types of properties
 *
 * There are three sets of properties the indexer is interested in:
 *
 * @li local properties;
 * @li inherited properties;
 * @li all properties.
 *
 * Lets cover each of these in more details.
 *
 * @subsection tack_property_indexer_11 Local properties
 *
 * On a natural, pre-indexed state, local properties encompass only
 * the properties defined on the class directly. The indexer behaves
 * differently depending on whether it is indexing an object or a
 * concept.
 *
 * For objects, the job of the indexer is to expand the local
 * properties to include all properties obtained by modeling
 * concepts. This is because we treat them no differently from
 * properties defined in the class for purposes of code generation. As
 * we rely on concept expansion, all we need is the set of all
 * properties of all concepts we model. Local properties are useful to
 * define all member variables owned by a class.
 *
 * For concepts, local properties are untouched. This is for two
 * reasons. First, because we rely on the local properties of concepts
 * to process the local properties of objects, as explained above, via
 * concept expansion; thus local properties provide a quick way to
 * access all the properties of all concepts one models. The second
 * reason is due to the representation of concepts in source code:
 * there is no requirement for a "meta-concept" - something from which
 * concepts get properties from. There is nothing above concepts that
 * replicate the relationship we have between concepts and
 * objects. When concepts get expressed in source code, all we require
 * is the set of all properties for that concept (see below).
 *
 * @subsection tack_property_indexer_12 Inherited properties
 *
 * These provide an easy way to look-up which properties one has
 * inherited and from whom. For objects, the inherited properties are
 * the "all property" set of each parent (see below). They are useful
 * to call parent constructors and the like.
 *
 * For concepts, inherited properties are not particularly useful. We
 * still index them by, arbitrarily, adding all the local properties
 * of the parent. However, we still haven't found a good use for them.
 *
 * @subsection tack_property_indexer_13 All properties
 *
 * The "all property" set contains every single property. It is the
 * sum all the local properties with all of the inherited
 * properties. For objects it is useful for full constructors. For
 * concepts it is effectively the full interface of the concept.

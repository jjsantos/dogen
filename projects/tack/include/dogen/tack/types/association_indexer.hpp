 *
 * @section tack_property_indexer_1 Indexing Process
 *
 * The indexer goes through all properties in objects and, for every
 * nested qualified name, unpacks all the associations implied by
 * their presence.
 *
 * Associations are of two types: @e regular or @e pointer. This
 * distinction is required due to the usage of the association at code
 * generation time.
 *
 * A @e regular association means a full type definition is required
 * to be available due to the association. A @e pointer definition
 * means that the type is used via pointer and as such a forward
 * declaration may suffice.

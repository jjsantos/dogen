/**
 * @brief Information indexer that specialises in indexing
 * concept-related relationships across the model.
 *
 * @section tack_concept_indexer_0 Model requirements
 *
 * The concept indexer expects to receive a partial model such as ones
 * coming straight out of Dia to TACK transformation.
 *
 * @section tack_concept_indexer_1 First stage: indexing concepts
 *
 * The concept indexer only touches two types of model elements:
 * concepts and abstract objects. This is because these are the only
 * two elements involved in relationships that involve concepts.
 *
 * The concept indexer starts by processing all concepts. Each concept
 * goes through two steps: @e expansion and @e reduction. Expansion is
 * defined as adding to each refined concept the set of all concepts
 * implied by the refinement graph of that concept: that is, the
 * concept itself, the concepts that the concept refines (lets call it
 * @e parents), the concepts that the parents refine and so on.
 *
 * Once the expansion is complete, reduction takes place: that is, all
 * duplicate concepts are removed. The final result is known as the @e
 * reduced @e concept @e set.
 *
 * Note that we use the word @e set here in the mathematical sense, as
 * implementation-wise we use lists manage these relationships. This
 * is because we aim to preserve order where possible; this is to
 * avoid having the code generation move (potentially dramatically)
 * every time any alteration is done to the concept hierarchy.
 *
 * @section tack_concept_indexer_2 Second stage: indexing objects
 *
 * The concept indexer is also responsible for updating the modeled
 * concepts in abstract objects. Thus only objects that are part of
 * such relationships are affected. For example a child which does not
 * model any concepts is not affected, even if its parent does model
 * concepts.
 *
 * Note that object indexing must be done after the concept indexing
 * described above as it depends on it.
 *
 * For objects which do not have parents, the operation is simple: for
 * a given object o, we just need to compute its reduced concept set
 * implied by its modeled concepts.
 *
 * For objects with parents things are slightly more complicated. We
 * must first compute the reduced concept set implied by all its
 * parents; this includes @e all modeled concepts found in the
 * entirety of the inheritance graph of a given object. Lets call that
 * set P. We then take the set of all concepts modeled by the object
 * directly (say R). The final set of modeled concepts for the object
 * is given by the set difference between R and S; that is, we remove
 * all concepts in R which are part of S - leaving those that only
 * exist in R but not in S.

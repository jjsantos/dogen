/**
 * @brief Formattables contains all types required by the formatters
 * and those used to generate them.
 *
 * @section cpp_1 Inclusion Directive and Inclusion Dependency
 *
 * In this module we use two similar terms with very different meanings:
 * inclusion directive and inclusion dependency.
 *
 * An inclusion directive is a string with delimiters but without the
 * #include pragma. For example "a/b/c,hpp" and <a/b/c.hpp> are
 * inclusion directives; note that the quotes and angle brackets are part
 * of the directive. There should be an inclusion directive associated
 * with every pair (name, formatter name). The inclusion directive
 * repository contains the complete set of inclusion directives - the
 * inclusion directives universe if you'd like.
 *
 * Inclusion dependencies are a set of inclusion directives.  They are
 * also associated with a pair (name, formatter).  The inclusion
 * dependences for each formatter are created by the inclusion
 * dependencies providers. Each formatter is expected to supply one of
 * one of these. It uses the inclusion directives available n the
 * repository to assemble the inclusion dependencies that the formatter
 * needs in order to generate a compilable C++ file.
